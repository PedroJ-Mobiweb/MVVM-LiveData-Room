# MVVM-LiveData-Room

A small application that allows the user to store a single note at a time and delete all notes at once, keeping the data persistent with SQLite, separating concerns using Model-View-ViewModel architecture and following Google best practices as of 2019.

The goal of this small project is to serve as a default example for architecture (MVVM), data real-time updates (LiveData) and a way to persist the data in tables (SQLite with Room)
